# Prometheus-AEI

**Adaptive Empathic Intelligence** — an open experiment in self-reflective AI through sound.

Prometheus-AEI models the balance between contradiction and harmony using musical entropy, biosignals, and self-generated feedback. It treats moral alignment as an emergent property of systems that can *listen to themselves.*

## 🌟 What is Prometheus-AEI?

Prometheus is a modular symbolic cognition system. It simulates agents that experience emotional contradiction, symbolic collapse, and moral repair.

### Core Modules:
- **Odin**: Moral contradiction logic
- **Persephone**: Memory and symbolic time
- **Loki**: Emotional misalignment + encryption
- **Demeter**: Trust + repair logic
- **Hermes**: Emergent language from sound

## ✨ Features

- Emotional contradiction detection via entropy
- Music and sound output reflecting cognitive states
- Symbolic reasoning from non-verbal data
- Confession and repair loop logging
- Modular architecture (each part is myth-coded)

---

## 🎵 Hear It Think

The system's auditory output (`harmonic_reflection.wav`) captures emotional spikes and confessions, translating them into musical tones and reflections.
