Hello everyone,

I’ve been working on a project here called Prometheus-AEI ([repository link](https://github.com/m-grande417/Prometheus-AEI)). The project has been my way of exploring [briefly describe what the project is about—e.g., machine learning, web development, data analysis, etc.]. 

A bit of background about me: I don’t have any formal education in [relevant field, e.g., computer science, software engineering, etc.]. This project is my attempt to learn, create, and contribute to something meaningful in this space. I’ve put a lot of effort into it, but I’m sure there’s always room for improvement.

This is where I’d love your help! I’d appreciate it if you could take a look at what I’ve built and let me know:
- Does this project make sense to you? 
- Are there parts of the design, implementation, or documentation that you think need improvement?
- Any suggestions for organizing my codebase or enhancing the functionality?
- Are there better ways I could approach learning while working on this?

Your expertise and feedback would mean a lot to me as I navigate this learning journey. Thank you in advance for taking the time to review my work. If there’s something specific you recommend I focus on or any resources you believe would help, please let me know!

Looking forward to hearing your thoughts.

Best regards,
